# YouTube-Cat-Runner-Control-Through-hand-and-body-Movement
This project is designed for learning based. Through computer vision we can control games and our system through hand gestures and body movement.
# Introduction
Welcome to a computer vision-powered project that brings a futuristic twist to human-computer interaction! This repository showcases two interactive applications that utilize OpenCV and MediaPipe to track body and hand gestures in real time:
1. üñêÔ∏è YouTube Gesture Control: Control YouTube playback (play, pause, skip, volume, etc.) with intuitive hand gestures, eliminating the need for mouse clicks.
2. üïπÔ∏è Cat Runner Game Control: Play a popular endless runner game using body movements ‚Äî jump, slide, or move sideways just by moving your body!
3. Designed with accessibility and fun in mind, this project explores how gesture recognition can redefine user experiences in both productivity and gaming environments.

# Conclusion
This project is a step toward more natural and immersive human-computer interactions using computer vision. Whether it's navigating YouTube hands-free or controlling a game with body motion, these applications demonstrate the potential of gesture-based interfaces in real-world scenarios. Contributions and suggestions are welcome ‚Äî feel free to fork the repo, report issues, or propose enhancements. Let‚Äôs build smarter, more intuitive digital experiences together!
